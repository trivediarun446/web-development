                <h5> Arun Trivedi (B-tech CSE )</h5>
                <blockquote>  

                    I am a passionate Computer Science Engineering (CSE) student at Pranveer Singh Institute of Technology (2023-2027) with expertise in programming languages like C, C++, MySql and Python, along with skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have a strong interest in ethical hacking, robotics, IoT, and Linux bash scripting. My academic journey includes High School and 10+2 from Dayanand Dinanath Education Center, and I have achieved significant milestones like a 4-star rating in Problem Solving on HackerRank and earning 100 Days and November Streak Badges on LeetCode. I have developed projects such as an Expense Tracker application using Python and SQL to manage online and cash payments efficiently, and a responsive Portfolio Website to showcase my skills and achievements. Proficient with tools like Linux, Vim, VS Code, and MySQL Workbench, I am driven by a vision to innovate and create impactful solutions for real-world problems.</blockquote>
